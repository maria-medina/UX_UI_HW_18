                 With Figma and Miro as tools, understading the target audience and their demographics is an essentail
                 foundation in any design process. Gathering research through quantitative surveys, qualitative
                 interviews, creating user personas, and building case studies are all chosen building blocks.

                With the use of per, paper, Ibis Paint X, and Figma to display the user's emotion visually. 
                The preferred method is storyboarding. Being able to relate to the user's experiences guides 
                the heart of the design process.

              With Figma, Miro, pen and paper as tools, being able to organize the brainstorming provides a solid structure. Some
               favored methods include card sorting, redlining, data analysis, annontation, generating ideas, and sketching. All of
               which propel the design process.
